        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating
        pleasure and extolling pain arose. To do so, I will give you a complete
        account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
        rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but
        because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally <pre>

         consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
        anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because
        it is pain, but  occur in which toil and pain
        can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of
        us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
        <br />
        advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
        chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one
        who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? [33] On the other
        hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so
        beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
        blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that
        are
